# PROJ1 - Visualization of sound reflections in a room
### Objectives:

1. **Create an Application for Visualizing Sound Reflections in a Room**  
   Develop a tool that enables users to observe sound reflections based on imported spatial impulse responses.  

2. **Processing Spatial Impulse Responses and 3D Images**  
   Implement algorithms for handling and analyzing spatial impulse response data and 3D room imagery.  

3. **Visualizing Reflections on a 3D Photo-Based Map**  
   Generate a visualization of reflection levels as a distribution map superimposed onto a 3D photograph of the space.
